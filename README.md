# Library Management System

This is a Java Swing based library management system that allows users to check out and return books, generate reports, and navigate between different sections of the app.

## Features
* A menu-driven project with various options to select and function.
* Proper reports can be generated with the necessary information to view the real-time updates and progress, with a click of a button.
* Friendly user interface: A library management system with functionalities to issue, return, and view the status of books should be user friendly enough so that the person handling it can get the work done efficiently.
* Real-time errors display: A proper provision to display error messages is provided so that the problem with the system can be known and resolved easily.
* Security: A secure system for logins and preventing unauthorized ones is provided so that no one uses it without permission.
* Validated entries are permitted: Each form has its validations, so the possibility of wrong entries is minimized.

## Tech Stack
* Java 8 or above
* A Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, etc.)


## Additional information
* The app uses a hardcoded list of books as an example, you can replace it with your own book data.
* The app uses a hardcoded login information, it is recommended to change this to a more secure method of authentication in a real-world implementation.
* The report generation, books, users, and transactions sections are not yet implemented, you can add your own code to implement these functionalities.
## Note
This code is just a skeleton of the library management system and the functionalities are not yet implemented. You can use this code as a starting point to develop your own library management system.
